# A unique html widget might be considered:
# Not available through plotly, dtable, DT etc.
# Designed to use a specific JavaScript library or behavior that isn't replicated elsewhere.

library(htmlwidgets)
# mywidget.R
mywidget <- function(data, width = NULL, height = NULL) {
  htmlwidgets::createWidget(
    name = "mywidget",
    x = list(data = data),

# Then in inst/htmlwidgets/mywidget.js, define how the widget should render using JavaScript.
# This form often encapsulates interactive graphics, maps, tables, or other UI elements.
